        <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>


    <pr>Hello! My name is Lefteris Athanasiou and I like coding a lot.
        The current programming languages I know are: HTML and CSS.
        I'm currently learning JavaScript. It's a pretty hard language,
        but I like it. It's like a puzzle to me. Think about a house that's
        being made. The HTML code is the structure, the CSS code is the decoration
        of the house, and JavaScript code is all of the functions of the house. (ps. electricity, etc.)
